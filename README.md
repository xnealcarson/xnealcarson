**More about me:** I’m a career-changing software engineer passionate about building dynamic and responsive web applications. My journey into software engineering began with a love for gaming and digital arts. I first explored web development by creating digital portfolios on Wix and Squarespace for my computer art and digital photography courses as part of my Computer Art major. Over the past year, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while working at an accredited web development agency.

During my two years in public archaeology, I cultivated strong critical research and problem-solving abilities. As a software engineer, I leverage these skills to design and develop purposeful websites and applications that push the boundaries of creativity, responsiveness, and accessibility for all users.
