**More about me:** I’m a software engineer passionate about full-stack web applications that are dynamic, responsive, and accessible. My journey began with a love for gaming and digital arts, where I first explored web development by building digital portfolios. Over the past year, I’ve sharpened my hard coding skills through hands-on experience at a web development agency. My background in public archaeology refined my research and problem-solving abilities, which I now leverage to design innovative, user-focused solutions.
