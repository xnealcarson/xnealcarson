**More about me:** I’m a software engineer passionate about full-stack web applications that are dynamic, responsive, and accessible. My interest in software engineering is rooted in a love for gaming and computer art, which I majored in at college. During my undergrad years, I had a brief exposure to web development creating my own digital portfolios for my computer art courses.  Over the past year, I’ve sharpened my hard coding skills through hands-on experience at a web development agency. My background in public archaeology refined my research and problem-solving abilities, which I now leverage to design innovative, user-focused solutions.
